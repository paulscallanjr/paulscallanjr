### My name is Paul Scallan Jr (known commonly as "Computer Paul" by locals who know me).  I am first and foremost a Tech Support Guru, but have other special talents in the following:  
              Search Engine Optimization ("SEO"), 
              PHP / MySQL / MariaDB / PeconaDB / HTML5 / HTML / JS code development, and 
              project management / operations management.  

### All of my skills and talents are based primarily on: 
              (1) Information Technology ("IT") experience, which began overall in 1981, yet professionally since 1999  and 
              (2) additional professional experience in the legal, general business, and business consultancy fields.  

### My overall work experience spans from residential to small businesses to enterprises and even to governmental entities.  My IT-specific experience ranges from system hardware to application software to networks of many types and architechtures and even to code development at a medium-level of complexity.
